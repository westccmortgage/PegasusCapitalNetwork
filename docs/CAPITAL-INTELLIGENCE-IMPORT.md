# Capital Intelligence — Daily Workbook Contract

One `.xlsx` workbook per day, uploaded manually in **Capital Intelligence →
Import Center**. Download the always-current template with **Download Import
Template** — it is generated from the same contract the importer uses.

## Global rules

- **File**: `.xlsx` only, max **4MB**. Macro-enabled (`.xlsm`) and legacy
  (`.xls`) files are rejected. **No formulas** — paste values only.
- **Sheets/headers**: names below, matched case- and spacing-insensitively.
  Extra sheets (e.g. your own notes) are ignored. All sheets are optional, but
  the file must contain at least one recognized sheet with data.
- **Confidence** is always one of: `Verified`, `Reported`, `Estimated`,
  `Unknown`. Verified > Reported > Estimated > Unknown. A lower-confidence
  value never silently overwrites a higher-confidence one — it becomes a
  conflict you resolve on the preview screen.
- **Blank = unknown.** Blank cells stay NULL; they never overwrite existing
  values and are never converted to 0.
- **Percent** columns accept `6.5` or `0.065` (both = 6.5%). Values in (0,1]
  are treated as fractions.
- **Currency** may include `$` and commas: `$5,250,000`.
- **Dates**: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `MM/DD/YYYY` (stored as ISO).
- **Booleans**: `true/false`, `yes/no`, `1/0`.
- **Duplicate protection**: the exact same file (checksum) is refused unless
  you force it; duplicate rows inside one file are marked invalid.

## Keys

- **Property_Key** — how other sheets point at a property. Priority:
  1. `Parcel_ID` (best), 2. `External_ID`, 3. the full street address.
  You may also write explicitly: `parcel:00-42…`, `ext:PBC-0007`, or
  `addr:123 Example St`. A property that is **new in the same file** can be
  referenced by the same key — the importer wires the rows together.
- **Contact_Key** — priority: 1. email, 2. `External_ID` (`ext:…`),
  3. `Name | Company` (`name:Jane Smith | Acme`). A bare value containing `@`
  is treated as an email.

## Sheets

### 1) Properties → `pci_properties`
`External_ID, Property_Name, Address, City, State, ZIP, County, Parcel_ID,
Latitude, Longitude, Property_Subtype, Building_SF, Land_Acres, Year_Built,
Asking_Price, NOI, Cap_Rate_Pct, Occupancy_Pct, Tenant_Count, Anchor_Tenant,
Listing_Status, Listing_URL, First_Seen_Date, Last_Seen_Date,
Opportunity_Score, Recommendation, Notes, Confidence, Source_URL,
Source_Title, Source_Date`

- Required: `Address`, `City`. County defaults to `Palm Beach`, State to `FL`.
- `Recommendation` (if given): `Act Now` / `Watch Closely` / `Pass` /
  `Unscored`. With an `Opportunity_Score`, a score-history row is recorded;
  if your recommendation differs from the thresholds (80/60), it is stored
  with an explicit override note.
- A changed `Asking_Price` or `Listing_Status` automatically records a
  listing event (price history timeline).

### 2) Property_Updates → field-level changes to `pci_properties`
`Property_Key, Field_Name, New_Value, Value_Type, Effective_Date, Confidence,
Source_URL, Source_Title, Notes`

- Updatable `Field_Name`s: `asking_price, noi, cap_rate_pct, occupancy_pct,
  tenant_count, anchor_tenant, listing_status, listing_url, last_seen_at,
  refinance_pressure_score, notes, property_name, building_sf, land_acres,
  year_built`.
- Record only genuine changes; identical values are reported as “unchanged”.

### 3) Contacts → existing CRM (`crm_contacts`)
`External_ID, Name, Company, Job_Title, Contact_Type, Email, Phone, Website,
LinkedIn_URL, City, State, Tags, Notes, Confidence, Last_Verified_Date,
Source_URL`

- Required: `Name`. Tags are comma-separated.
- Created contacts are owned by the importing admin, `source='import'`;
  `External_ID` is kept in `metadata.external_id` for future dedupe.

### 4) Property_Contacts → `pci_property_contacts`
`Property_Key, Contact_Key, Relationship_Role, Is_Primary, Confidence,
Source_URL`

- `Relationship_Role`: `owner_entity, principal, listing_broker,
  leasing_broker, property_manager, current_lender, attorney, title_contact,
  other`.

### 5) Loans → `pci_loans`
`External_ID, Property_Key, Lender_Contact_Key, Lien_Position,
Original_Amount, Recorded_Date, Instrument_Number, Estimated_Balance,
Interest_Rate_Pct, Rate_Type, Maturity_Date, Maturity_Basis, Loan_Type,
Recourse, DSCR, LTV_Pct, Status, Confidence, Source_URL, Notes`

- Required: `Property_Key`. `Maturity_Basis` uses the confidence vocabulary.
- Dedupe: `Instrument_Number` → `External_ID` → property+lender+date+amount.
- `Lender_Contact_Key` may be a Contact_Key or a plain lender name (stored as
  a snapshot when no CRM contact matches).

### 6) Tenants → `pci_tenants`
`Property_Key, Tenant_Name, Suite, Leased_SF, Lease_Start, Lease_Expiration,
Annual_Rent, Market_Rent, Category, Credit_Quality, Rollover_Risk,
Confidence, Source_URL, Notes`

- Dedupe: property + tenant + suite.

### 7) Distress_Signals → `pci_distress_signals`
`External_ID, Property_Key, Signal_Type, Event_Date, Status,
Case_or_Instrument_No, Amount, Summary, Confidence, Source_URL, Source_Title`

- `Signal_Type`: `foreclosure, lis_pendens, bankruptcy, tax_lien,
  code_violation, ucc, receiver, delinquency, maturity_pressure,
  price_reduction, withdrawn_relisted, other`.

### 8) Lender_Programs → `pci_lender_programs`
`External_ID, Lender_Contact_Key, Program_Name, Capital_Source_Type,
Florida_Appetite, Retail_Appetite, Stabilized_or_Value_Add, Min_Loan,
Max_Loan, Max_LTV_Pct, Max_LTC_Pct, Min_DSCR, Recourse, Interest_Only,
Term_Months, Amortization_Years, Rate_Guidance, Fees, Prepayment,
Active_Status, Last_Verified_Date, Confidence, Source_URL, Notes`

- Required: `Lender_Contact_Key`. Appetites read best as `Yes` / `No` /
  `Selective`. Programs unverified for 90+ days are flagged stale in the UI.

### 9) Daily_Actions → `pci_daily_actions`
`Priority, Action_Type, Property_Key, Contact_Key, Due_Date, Action, Reason,
Notes`

- Required: `Action`. Identical still-open actions are skipped (no daily
  duplicates). Priority 1 = highest.

## Sources

Every sheet’s `Source_URL` (+ `Source_Title`, `Source_Date` where present)
is collected into `pci_sources`, deduplicated by normalized URL — provenance
is preserved once per source, referenced everywhere.

## The import lifecycle

1. **Preview** — validation, dedupe, and a full plan (new / updates /
   unchanged / conflicts / invalid). Nothing is applied. The original file is
   stored privately under `imports/YYYY/MM/`.
2. **Resolve** — for each conflict: *Skip (decide later)* · *Keep existing* ·
   *Apply incoming*.
3. **Approve & Commit** — one transaction; full change log; Verified data
   protected.
4. **Roll back** — last committed batch only, and only if nothing it touched
   was modified afterwards; otherwise the system refuses and lists blockers.
5. **Report** — per-row CSV report downloadable for any batch.

## QA fixture

`qa/intelligence-audit.js` builds an in-memory sanitized fixture workbook
(obviously fake QA values) and runs it through the real parser and planner —
`npm run qa:intelligence`.
